 An app to connect FPI(Food Processing Industries) directly with Domestic Retailers

The idea is to connect FPI directly with the Domestic Retailers in India and ease the business process between them. 
This application is for the Domestic Retailers. Through this app the retailers can update their demands and directly purchase Products from the nearby FPI(s).
Developed by the team of six members, the app provides a single platform through which both FPI and the domestic retailers can sell and buy several products directly. Used Firebase Realtime Database, Natural Language Processing for AI-Smart Assistant which provides better voice search results, GeoFire Library for selectively loading nearby FPI(s) and an integrated payment portal. 
Also the app categories the Nearby FPI(s) in a sorted manner on the basis of percentage product matched and the nearest distance from the Retailer

This App is Data driven Application so the results in the application will be shown only if the Retailer have updated his product requirement through the update demand section.
Also the Nearby FPI(s) are shoen in the app if there were any present in the nearby registered location of the retailer.

#for testing purpose initially FPI(s) are registered in the NCR,india region, so if you test the retailer app in NCR region more effective results will be shown
